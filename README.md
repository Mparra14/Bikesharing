## Overview:

In this project, we were tasked with creating a business proposal to a potential investor that would help launch a bike-sharing business in Des Moines, Iowa. In order to create a business proposal for this bikesharing idea, we have to find statistical data of another city that may be using a bikesharing company in their city. Citibank is one of the main bikesharing companies that is being used as transportation in the city of New York. We were able to get Citibank's information as a csv file, we were then asked to use a new tool called Tableau. This tool is used to create visualizations that are able to bring the date collected to life, and make it much more concised than a csv file. Using this new tool we were able to create tables that demonstrate specific information that would be useful to analyse the benifits of investing in a bikesharing business. 

## Results:

![checked_out_bikes](https://github.com/Mparra14/Bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Checkout%20time%20.png)

In the table above we are able to see the amount of rides and the duration of the rides themeselves. It can be seen that the majority of customers that are renting Citibank bikes are only renting them for about 5 minutes, which means that they are using them only for short distances. Even though there are traveling short distances the amount of bikes checked out for these distances is significantly high. This is to be seen since NYC is divided by blocks and people tend to get to their destination much faster do to their geographical infrastructure. 

![checked_out_bikes_by gender](https://github.com/Mparra14/Bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/checkout%20time%20by%20gender.png)

In this table the line graph is distrubuted by gender and it shows which gender had the highest amount of checkouts and their checkout times. Like we saw in the previous graph, the amount of time that riders are checking the bikes out for is still around 5 mins. This graph also shows the gender that checks out the most bikes are males rather than females. 

![trips_by_weekday]()

This table shows which hour and which days have the most riders using the bikes. In this visualization we aren't using a normal graph, we are using a heat map in which the darker sections shows a higher amount of riders using the bikes, while the lighter areas show that least amount of riders. Looking at the heat map, we can see that the times that the bikes are highly used is 5-6 PM and also 8 AM, this is mostly seen on weekdays.This trend is predictable since this are times that riders could be using the bike to get to work or get home from work.
