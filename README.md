## Overview:

In this project, we were tasked with creating a business proposal to a potential investor that would help launch a bike-sharing business in Des Moines, Iowa. In order to create a business proposal for this bikesharing idea, we have to find statistical data of another city that may be using a bikesharing company in their city. Citibank is one of the main bikesharing companies that is being used as transportation in the city of New York. We were able to get Citibank's information as a csv file, we were then asked to use a new tool called Tableau. This tool is used to create visualizations that are able to bring the date collected to life, and make it much more concised than a csv file. Using this new tool we were able to create tables that demonstrate specific information that would be useful to analyse the benifits of investing in a bikesharing business. 

## Results:

In the table above we are able to see the amount of rides and the duration of the rides themeselves. It can be seen that the majority of customers that are renting Citibank bikes are only renting them for about 5 minutes, which means that they are using them only for short distances. Even though there are traveling short distances the amount of bikes checked out for these distances is significantly high. This is to be seen since NYC is divided by blocks and people tend to get to their destination much faster do to their geographical infrastructure.
