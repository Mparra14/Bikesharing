# Bikesharing

## Overview:

In this project, we were tasked with creating a business proposal to a potential investor that would help launch a bike-sharing business in Des Moines, Iowa. In order to create a business proposal for this bikesharing idea, we have to find statistical data of another city that may be using a bikesharing company in their city. Citibank is one of the main bikesharing companies that is being used as transportation in the city of New York. We were able to get Citibank's information as a csv file, we were then asked to use a new tool called Tableau. This tool is used to create visualizations that are able to bring the date collected to life, and make it much more concised than a csv file. Using this new tool we were able to create tables that demonstrate specific information that would be useful to analyse the benifits of investing in a bikesharing business. 

## Results:

![checked_out_bikes](https://github.com/Mparra14/Bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Checkout%20time%20.png)

In the table above we are able to see the amount of rides and the duration of the rides themeselves. It can be seen that the majority of customers that are renting Citibank bikes are only renting them for about 5 minutes, which means that they are using them only for short distances. Even though there are traveling short distances the amount of bikes checked out for these distances is significantly high. This is to be seen since NYC is divided by blocks and people tend to get to their destination much faster do to their geographical infrastructure. 

![checked_out_bikes_by gender](https://github.com/Mparra14/Bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/checkout%20time%20by%20gender.png)

In this table the line graph is distrubuted by gender and it shows which gender had the highest amount of checkouts and their checkout times. Like we saw in the previous graph, the amount of time that riders are checking the bikes out for is still around 5 mins. This graph also shows the gender that checks out the most bikes are males rather than females. 

![trips_by_weekday](https://github.com/Mparra14/Bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Trips%20by%20weekday%20.png)

This table shows which hour and which days have the most riders using the bikes. In this visualization we aren't using a normal graph, we are using a heat map in which the darker sections shows a higher amount of riders using the bikes, while the lighter areas show that least amount of riders. Looking at the heat map, we can see that the times that the bikes are highly used is 5-6 PM and also 8 AM, this is mostly seen on weekdays.This trend is predictable since this are times that riders could be using the bike to get to work or get home from work. 

![Trips_by_gender](https://github.com/Mparra14/Bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/trips%20by%20weekday%20by%20gender%20.png)

Using the same heat map data from the graph above, we were able to distribute this data to differentiate between genders. As we have seen previously, males have the most bikes checked out unlike females. The darker regions are still seen in the same hours at 8:00 AM and between 5:00-6:00 PM. This type of trend can be explained that possibly females may feel safer in other transportation methods, or the unknowns can also be unclassiefied females. 

![user_trips_by_genders](https://github.com/Mparra14/Bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/User%20types%20by%20weekday.png)

The table above shows yet another heat map, but the information that is gathered is divided by genders, and also by the type of users. There are two types, subscribers and regular customers. Looking at the graph we can see that again males have a higher bike usage than females, this also shows that subscribers are the highest users specifically male subscribers. 

![user_types](https://github.com/Mparra14/Bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/customers.png)

This pie chart shows the division of the type of users that are checking out the bikes, the majority as you can see in the orange regions are the subscribers and the blue section is the just the customers. As we have seen previously, the highest amount of users of the Citibank bikes are the subscribers. 

![peak_hours](https://github.com/Mparra14/Bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/peak%20hours.png)

In this last graph, we can see a horizontal bar graph that shows the hours that have the most users checking out bikes and we see a clearer view of which hour is the most favored by users, and is clear that the majority uses the bike at 5:00 PM. We had already seen this trend in the graphs above, but we are able to visualize the usage better using this bar graph.



## Summary: 

Having looked at the data from Citibank in NYC, we can concur that most of the users utilizing this service are subscribers as well as males. We also had confirmation on the hours that are preferred by the users being 5:00 PM, 6:00 PM and 8:00 AM. The last piece of information that we were able to gather from our data is the avarage checkout time for the bike service, which came out to be at around 5 minutes. Using this information, we can base the bikesharing business in Des Moines and make it work for this city.
